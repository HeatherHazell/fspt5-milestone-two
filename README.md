## Tips

- Write pseudocode before writing code.

## Steps to run the test

```bash
yarn
yarn test
```

## Self-Assessment

Give yourself a grade for each question. Explain why you gave yourself that grade.

| Grade | Explanation                                                        |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   4   | I understood this completely and did not struggle answering it.    |
|   3   | I think I did well, but I didn't totally understand why it worked. |
|   2   | I think I was close, but I didn't get the answer.                  |
|   1   | I am struggling with this question.                                |
|   0   | I did not attempt this question (explain why)                      |

### 1. Create and extend classes

- Grade: 3
- Explanation: I get classes (I thought) and would have said 4 but I keep having an error with my test and it's probably something so simply!

### 2. Create tests for classes

- Grade:3
- Explanation: As I mentioned above, ERRORS! WHY!?

### 3. Use HOFs from the Array prototype

- Grade: 3
- Explanation: When I tested these in console log, it worked well. Does it work with the \_hofs.js? I'll never know because of the class error.

### 4. Create the reverse linked list method

- Grade: 3
- Explanation: I did this, with help from google. And I got it. But I truly dislike linked lists haha. I will practice more.
